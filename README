HLS (HTTP Live Streaming - the HTTP streaming technology used by iOS
devices) represents a video as a series of chunks each of which must
start on a GOP boundary.

This program accepts as input an MPEG 2 transport stream and splits it
into suitable chunks for use with HLS.

It's based on ffmpeg and uses libavformat, libavcodec and friends to
copy GOP (or multi-GOP) chunks. The audio and video is not re-encoded as
it passes through tssplit.
